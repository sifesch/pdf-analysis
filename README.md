# Analysis of a PDF containing a Leistungsverzeichnis 

A Python-based tool for extracting unstructured data from a German construction tender PDF (Leistungsverzeichnis), transforming it in a structured format and showing insights on the respective tender. 

A Leistungsverzeichnis (bill of quantities or tender document) lists all construction tasks and materials for a project.

## Introduction
In this repository we analyze a PDF containing a tender for building a single-family house. It contains various main and sub-positions representing necessary work hours and goods necessary for building the house.

To extract data from the PDF and parse the unstructured text data into a structured form, we utilize the pdfplumber, regex, and pandas library.

This project represents only an initial Analysis and does not go in depth.

## Navigation

In the Notebook `data_analysis_LV.ipynb`, we utilize the MetaDataExtractor and PDFPostionExtractor class to extract data and show contents of the extracted data.

## Setup

### Dependencies

Built with Python 3.12.7 (lower versions are likely also compatible)

Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies from requirements.txt file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Data

For this project we utilized a PDF which represents a tender for a single-family house. The data can be found under the following link:

The PDF is **not included** in this repository. It remains the property of WK Statik GmbH and is used here solely for educational purposes.

## Further Work

- Test robustness of created MetaDataExtractor and PDFPostionsExtractor class for other tenders for single-family households and adjust classes accordingly
- Gain more insights into the tender:
  - Calculate/Visualize total amount of work hours necessary (Also by task)
  - Calculate/Visualize total amount of raw materials necessary (Also by material type)
  - etc.
- Extract more insights from within each position description to extract more information in a structured way.
